# SimpleMaze

# Just made some simple maze, which includes player icon and controlling with touching the red "boxes"
# This is the 16-red blocks as a 1 big red block 4x4. There's no walls, so you can go through them, because I don't know how to make them now
# I hope, I'll improve this thing, but now it sucks
